	 <h1 id="seven">RULES</h1>
	  <p id="five">A mandatory briefing on indoor kart racing safety and rules will be given to all new riders. Initial D Karting recommends that racers should wear closed-toe shoes and long hair should be pulled back into a ponytail. We will provide you with all of the necessary racing equipment. Please keep in mind that indoor karting is not an amusement ride and it is real racing. Accidents can happen if you do not follow the rules and pay attention to flags.<br>
	  <br>Indoor kart racing is a non-contact sport. We do not tolerate any bumping or blocking of go karts. There is no excuse for contact if you are unable to pass a kart. Initial D Karting has a strict policy of not allowing alcohol and/or drug abuse. Anyone who appears to be impaired will not be allowed to compete. Those with neck or back difficulties, as well as those with cardiac diseases, should avoid kart racing. If you have any doubt, please check with your doctor prior to racing.<br></p>
